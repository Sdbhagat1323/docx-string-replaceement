Notwithstanding the foregoing, information which is orally or visually disclosed to the Recipient by the Company, or is disclosed in writing without an appropriate letter, proprietary stamp or legend, shall constitute Proprietary Information if (i) it would be apparent to a reasonable person, familiar with the Company’s business and the industry in which it operates, that such information is of a confidential or proprietary nature the maintenance of which is important to the Company or if (ii) the Company, within {{Disclosure_days}} days after such disclosure, delivers to the Recipient a written document or documents describing such Proprietary Information and referencing the place and date of such oral, visual or written disclosure.
